    "Brief history of your project and organization": "ELIXIR coordinates and develops life science resources across Europe so that researchers can more easily find, analyse and share data, exchange expertise, and implement best practices. This makes it possible for them to gain greater insights into how living organisms work.\n\nELIXIR has compiled a list of resources that it recommends for the deposition of experimental data. The scientific community has a shared responsibility to ensure long-term data preservation and accessibility. The purpose of this Deposition Databases list is to provide guidance to those who formulate policy and working practices about the appropriate repositories for publishing open data in the life sciences.\n\nAn ELIXIR Deposition Database is defined as being part of the ELIXIR Node portfolio of services that accepts deposition of experimental data from an international community of researchers beyond the funding envelope of the database itself.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases\n\nThere are many datasets here, including ArrayExpress, BioModels, EMDB, EMPIAR, MetaboLights, and the total amount of data stored should exceed 4PiB",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We generate and send cars and related orders based on this document: https://github.com/tech-greedy/singularity/blob/main/getting-started.md.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/\nhttps://www.modelarchive.org/\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01531188 HK \nf03241413 ShenZhen \nf03238633 SG \nf03241579 ShenZhen\nf03312989  HK\nf02826126 HK\nf02827880   HK\nf02827288   ShangHai\nf02827045  ShangHai\nf03358608   HK",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
