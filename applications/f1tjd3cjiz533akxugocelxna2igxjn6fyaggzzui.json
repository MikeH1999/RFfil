    "Brief history of your project and organization": "For fifteen years, Qitian has exclusively focused on CG comic/concept art training. Over the years, we've perfected CG artistry as a specialized field! Tailored to diverse employer needs, we categorize CG art into anime/comics, game concept art, film/TV concept art, commercial illustration, and traditional Chinese-style illustration. We also offer a \"Foundational Art\" course for students starting from scratch.\n\n    Each specialized style aligns with distinct professional fields, with career opportunities available at animation studios, game development companies, film and television production houses, advertising agencies, and publishing houses. Our curriculum is meticulously designed so that mastery of even a specific segment of the course equips students to secure relevant professional positions.",
